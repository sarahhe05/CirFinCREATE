# CirFinCREATE - ECOMENU üå±üç≥
Our project ECOMENU is a recipe recommendation platform that empowers users to make environmentally conscious food choices. The app focuses on sustainability by recommending recipes based on the carbon footprint of their ingredients. By leveraging a database of 350 food ingredients and 2000 recipes, the app provides users with options that minimize environmental impact. We aim to make sustainability a part of everyday cooking, contributing to a more climate-conscious world.

## Data
We compiled carbon footprint and environmental data from multiple data sources for a comprehensive collection.
