Balancing life's demands while considering the best choices for the planet can be challenging. As students, parents, and working adults, our decisions are often driven by our immediate needs, such as income and the care of loved ones. However, we believe that caring for our planet shouldn't be a compromise but rather a convenient task integrated into our daily lives. That's why we've created Ecomenu‚Äîa platform designed to empower families to make sustainable, environmentally-conscious meals with ease.

To bring this idea to life, we gathered data on popular and sustainable recipes, along with their associated carbon emissions. After thoroughly cleaning the data to ensure consistency and accuracy, we developed an efficient program that displays recipes based on user input. Through this process, we learned how to effectively sort and extract information in various formats. Additionally, as we tested our programs, it became evident just how significantly the carbon emissions of each meal can impact our environment over time.

One of the challenges we faced was finding and learning about a suitable hosting engine for our website. Furthermore, due to the varying formats within the database, we had to devise creative solutions to accurately extract values such as units, amounts, and ingredients in order to calculate the carbon footprint of each recipe.
